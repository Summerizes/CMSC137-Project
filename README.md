                                                  Description of the Game:
A famous card game with an objective of getting a four of a kind. A player initially gets 4 cards assuming that no one still has a complete four of a kind, everybody will say 1-2-3 pass then will pass a card. This will run until someone met the objective. When someone finishes he/she will put his/her hand on the table, then everyone will follow. The last one to do so loses.
